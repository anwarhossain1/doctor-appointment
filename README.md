This is a react based web application for doctor appointment booking.</br>
<a href="https://appointus.netlify.app/" target="__blank">Live Website</a>

</br>

 I have named this web app <span>AppointUS</span>. Materials added into this project are,

<ul>
<li>When a user lands on this application the first page will show a list of doctors based
on a JSON file where all the doctors list have been added.</li>
<li>Upon selecting a doctor from the list the user will be forwarded to a second page
where they will be presented with a calendar by which they can view doctor's available time slots.</li>
<li>On clicking in a slot the user will be prompted for a form to give some booking
information like name, phone number, visit reason, etc.</li>
<li></li>
<ul>

Technologies used in this project have been given below:-
<ul>
<li>ReactJS as a framework/library</li>
<li>Redux for managing states</li>
<li>Ant design for designing</li>
</ul>

I have a plan to add also some other features like:- 

<ul>
<li>When user will be forwarded to a second page from the first page, they will be presented with a calendar where only the dates match with the
doctor's availability will be active. For the first doctor like "Dr. John Doe" only Sunday and
Wednesday in the calendar will be active.</li>
<li>On clicking an active date the doctor will be given a list of slots. Suppose if the user
clicks on any Sunday for "Dr. John Doe" he will be presented with slots from "10:00
AM" to "06:00 PM" with 15 minutes duration like "10:00 AM", "10:15 AM", "10:30 AM"
and so on based on his availability in that JSON file.</li>

</ul>
